            <p>This is my best friend. Her name is Mak. I've known her since middle school, but we got closer in high school. We play softball together.</p>
            <p>I also have other friends at school. <em>My favorite thing to do with them is go out to eat!</em> I also enjoy playing bored games with them.</p>
